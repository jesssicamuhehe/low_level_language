0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
Here, we learned & implemented the use of arithmetic operators, logical operators also known as boolean operators and relational operators while working on the various tasks.
We also learnt how to declare variables and to use comments for better understanding of what our program entails.
The program tasks performs the following functions:
0-positive_or_negative.c
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

1-last_digit.c
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

2-print_alphabet.c
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

3. alphABET
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

4-print_alphabt.c
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

5-print_numbers.c
This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

6-print_numberz.c
This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

7-print_tebahpla.c
This program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

8-print_base16.c
This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

9-print_comb.c
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. The Numbers are separated by ",", followed by a space and printed in ascending order.

100-print_comb3.c
This program prints all possible combination of two digits. The Numbers are separated byÂ ",", followed by a space. The program prints only the smallest combination of two digits in ascending order.

101-print_comb4.c
The program prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

102-print_comb5.c
This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers and the numbers ranges from 0 to 99.
